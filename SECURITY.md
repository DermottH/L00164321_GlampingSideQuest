## Security Best Practices

We encourage all users to follow these general security best practices:
- **Stay Up-to-Date**: Keep your dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- **Review Code**: Regularly review pull requests and contributions to ensure no security issues are introduced.
- **Limit Permissions**: Avoid unnecessary permissions or overly broad access in your configuration files.
- **Use Strong Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), for sensitive actions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
### Steps to Report:
1. **Contact Us**: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to [security@example.com] or use our private issue tracker at [Example link ](https://example.com). Ensure you include:

   - A brief overview of the impact and severity (if known)

2. **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an initial response with guidance on how we will handle the vulnerability.

3. **Coordination**: We aim to work with you to coordinate the responsible disclosure of the vulnerability. We will prioritize timely fixes, but may need additional time depending on the complexity of the issue.

4. **Patch Development**: Upon verification, we will develop and test a patch, which will be released as soon as possible. You will be notified once the patch is ready and the update is deployed.
